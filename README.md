## About

This is the comprehensive course materials and syllabus to be **Junior Software Developer** made by a non-profit team dedicated to providing free coding education. Through this program, you'll acquire a versatile technology stack, enabling you to create anything from a basic website to a robust database-driven web and mobile applications.


Also, this is a **quickly path** for **self-taught** who want to be a **Junior Software Developer** with an accelerated course on your own time, **for free**, by  **professionals in the field** from all over the world.

## Motivation


**#1** The first one is the imperative need of share my knowledge. Human knowledge, science and technology would be nothing if they weren't shared. Also some day I will die, so this is proof that I once existed in the vast universe.
> JRichardsz

**#2** The second is to help to the young people, underprivileged communities, marginalized groups, asylum seekers, and disadvantaged individuals to be prepared to obtain a job locally or in any part of world. Not everyone has the opportunity to take class on a University or Institute , public or private. So if you are self-taught, here you could gain knowledge to be prepared to affront a job, earn money, pay your rent, help yours and of course share what you learn.

**#3** Elon Musk quote about **self-taught**: I don't have an aerospace degree. I just have a physics background. That's helpful as a foundation and then I read a lot of books and talked to a lot of lot of smart people.

**#4** With this initiative I don't mean we should not study.Quite the opposite: We need to study a lot but to address the complex challenges of our rapidly evolving world. It's imperative that we cultivate a new generation of innovators well-versed in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Developing a deep understanding of fundamental principles, particularly in physics, is crucial for shaping the future. Rather than merely memorizing formulas, it's essential to grasp the underlying thought process, cultivating a mindset that enables you to analyze complex phenomena, think critically, and drive meaningful breakthroughs.
