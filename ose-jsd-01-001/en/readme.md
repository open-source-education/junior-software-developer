# English for software developers

All over the world, IT professionals and software developers are required to know English at a high level in order to be able to work with colleagues and help clients.
However, English for programmers, engineers, and IT professionals is quite specific.

Here some good reasons of the importance of English to a software engineer:

- Nearly every programming language’s syntax is in English
- Technical documentation of some company’s public API will *at least* be available in English
- Imagine working on an international team that operates across multiple countries. Code - documentation will most likely be written in English, as it is understood in each country
- Educational material that is only provided in English (courses, tutorials, …)

# Syntax

As it's been pointed out, almost every programming language one can think of have English-ish semantics, and make sense faster if you have a knowledge of English. Although a programming language can probably be implemented in a non-English manner, with keywords and constructs from any language you choose, its ultimately pointless, as it all gets converted to low-level code anyway, a zone where 'human' languages don't exist. English words are used only to make sense of the programming constructs. (for example, "if-else","do-while","#define"etc.).

As all forms of software development should be accessible to an international programming community, what better language to use than the international language English? Thus most tutorials, API references, and the languages themselves use English. English is the language you'll probably use to communicate with software developers from different social and ethnic backgrounds. You can't go anywhere without being at least decent in English.
